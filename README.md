# Basic Single Page Application (SPA) with MVC Pattern using TypeScript
Note: This project is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. It is developed solely for practicing purposes and does not follow best coding practices or maintain clear code.

This repository contains a basic Single Page Application (SPA) and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. The application aims to provide a rudimentary understanding of how JS can be used in conjunction with the MVC architecture.

# Introduction
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the concept of the MVC pattern web application. Please keep in mind that the code may not adhere to industry best practices, and it may lack proper code organization, optimization, and documentation.

# Installation
To run the application, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Node.js (version 18 or higher) installed on your machine.

To install the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

• git clone https://github.com/zivoradt/JavaScript-TypeScript.git<br>

Change into the project directory:

• cd your-repo<br>

Install the dependencies:

• npm install<br>

# Getting Started
To start the application, use the following command:

• npm start<br>

# Project Structure
The project follows a basic version of the MVC pattern:

• index.html: The entry point of the application, which contains the basic HTML structure.<br>
• src/: The TypeScript directory, holding all the application logic.<br>
• model.js: Represents the Model, responsible for managing the data and business logic.<br>
• view.js: Represents the View, handling the user interface and rendering data to the DOM.<br>
• controller.js: Represents the Controller, mediating between the Model and View, processing user input, and updating the Model and View accordingly.<br>
• index.js: The main TypeScript file, which sets up the server and initializes the application.<br>

#Usage
This basic SPA allows you to perform the following actions:

• View the initial data on the page load.<br>
• Add new data items.<br>
• Edit existing data items.<br>
• Delete data items.<br>

Please note that this is a minimalistic application developed purely for educational purposes. It does not include advanced features, data persistence, or server communication.
